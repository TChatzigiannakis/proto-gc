# Proto

A single-threaded stop-the-world non-generational non-compacting conservative tracing garbage collector (i.e. the simplest possible).

It was written in C in a single afternoon as a personal exercise. It is not meant for any production use, as it has very few features, possibly hidden bugs, and reliance on implementation-specific behavior (at best).
